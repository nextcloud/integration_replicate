## Ethical AI Rating
### Speech-to-Text Rating: ðŸŸ¡

Positive:
* The software for training and inference of this model is open source
* The trained model is freely available, and thus can be run on-premises

Negative:
* The training data is not freely available, limiting the ability of external parties to check and correct for bias or optimise the modelâ€™s performance and CO2 usage.

### Text processing Rating

The rating depends on the model you select to use.

### Image generation Rating
